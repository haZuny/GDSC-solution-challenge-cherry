# Introduction
### Problem situation
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64102831/227731796-74e7d4d1-7499-4ba3-a2a1-947ec1cd7b44.jpg" width="800"/>
According to data from the Ministry of Employment and Labor last year, the construction industry ranks first in fatal accidents every year due to the nature of the industry.

Most of the types of accidents account for a large proportion of drops, pinches, and collisions, which occurred **because of the absence of wearing safety equipment.**
However, there is a limit to the past punishment and regulatory-oriented policies alone.

We prevent accidents in various situations by **creating customizable checklists through the Cherry app** so that field managers can check the status of safety facilities. In addition, all workers are trying to reduce accidents without a safety helmet by **recognizing whether to wear a safety helmet through a camera**

<br>

### What is Sustainable Development Goals?
![un_goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64102831/227727869-2bce4aef-fd09-470a-a489-ab64090727ee.png)
The Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) or Global Goals are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.
As can be seen in the figure above, there are 17 goals.

### Our goal
We have noted decent work and economic growth among the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. We're going to create a system with the app that helps protect workers' labor rights and create a safe working environment.

#### Goal 8. Decent work and economic growth

Cherry focused on **providing a safer environment for workers on construction sites.**

Many workers at the construction site are working without knowing whether the safety inspection of the construction site has been properly performed. **The absence of these safety inspections gives workers anxiety and has the risk of causing a major accident.** We paid attention to this situation and discussed ways to provide a safer working environment for workers.

Our Cherry **provides a checklist** that must be checked by managers at each site before starting work. These daily inspections make managers more concerned about safety inspections on site. In addition, workers can check the check status of the day and work comfortably in a safer environment.

**Workers as well as managers should check their safety equipment before work.** There are many cases of working without proper safety equipment leading to major accidents. Workers check their current safety equipment wearing status through Cherry and send the results to the manager. In this way, we can ensure a safer working environment.

### 2. Create a site and view the site check code.
If you sign up as an administrator, create a site after entering the information of the work site. Upon completion of creation, you can view the site's unique check code

### 3. Join in the site
Workers can join in by entering the unique code of the site they want to sign up for. When a worker applies for join, the manager accept/rejects the user.

### 4. Check helmet and submit
Workers can inspect whether helmets are worn and submit the results to the manager. Administrators can view a list of users who have completed helmet checks.
